# Simple Counter Project

Welcome to my Simple Counter Project repository! This project is a minimalistic web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase a basic interactive counter. The goal is to provide a straightforward example of how these technologies can work together to create a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
